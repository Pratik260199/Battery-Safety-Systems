# Runs different models of li-ion grid storage safety systems, battery operation and cost

import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib
# import any other models from different files as necessary 
import systemConstruction 

# construct a cell system based on data within the google spreadsheet "Battery System Components"
# specify chemistry, cathode thickness
# calculate cost of cells 

# model the performance of the system constructed, add safety technologies to match performance model & temperature 
# specify a location, get temperature data (MERRA)


# run pybamm to estimate maximum heat generated, other important parameters for safety technologies 
# calculate module costs, rack costs housing costs
